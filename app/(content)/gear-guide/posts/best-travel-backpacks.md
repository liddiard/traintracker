Choosing the right backpack can make or break your train travel experience. Unlike airline travel with its strict overhead bin requirements, train travel offers more flexibility - but that doesn't mean any bag will do.

## What Makes a Great Train Travel Backpack?

### Key Features to Look For

- **Comfortable straps** - You'll be carrying it through stations
- **Easy access compartments** - Quick access to tickets, snacks, and devices
- **Laptop sleeve** - Padded protection for your electronics
- **Water bottle pockets** - Stay hydrated without opening your bag
- **Durable materials** - Train stations can be rough on gear

### Size Considerations

For train travel, we recommend:

- **Day trips**: 20-25L backpack
- **Overnight trips**: 30-40L backpack
